# LibraryManagement

**LibraryManagement** is a C# console application designed to showcase a robust n-tier architecture by clearly separating concerns across different layers. The solution is organized into multiple projects, including a core library that holds shared interfaces and models, making it an excellent example for developers looking to implement modular, maintainable, and testable designs in their applications.

## Features

- **N-Tier Architecture:**  
  Demonstrates a clear separation of concerns by dividing the application into distinct layers.
- **Modular Design:**  
  Organized into multiple projects, making the codebase easier to manage and extend.
- **Interface-Based Development:**  
  Uses interfaces to define contracts between layers, ensuring a decoupled and testable design.
- **Core Library:**  
  Shared models and interfaces reside in a central core layer that all projects can reference.
- **Educational Value:**  
  Serves as a practical example for learning how to implement separation of concerns in a real-world C# application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK:**  
  Download the latest version from the [official .NET site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **Code Editor:**  
  Use Visual Studio, VS Code, or any editor of your choice.
- **Basic C# Knowledge:**  
  Familiarity with C# and n-tier architectural concepts will help you get the most out of this project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ctoner2652/LibraryManagement.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd LibraryManagement

3. **Build the Project**

   For .NET projects, build the solution using:

   ```bash
   dotnet build

---

## Usage

After building the project, run the application with:
```bash
dotnet run
```
Follow the console prompts to explore how the application manages different layers and performs operations across them. This demonstration of separation of concerns is both practical and insightful.

## Code Overview

The project is structured into several key layers:

- **Core Layer:**  
  Contains shared models and interfaces used across all layers.
- **Data Access Layer (DAL):**  
  Implements data access logic, showcasing how to interact with data sources in a decoupled manner.
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL):**  
  Handles the business rules and logic, ensuring that the core operations remain independent of the data and presentation layers.
- **Presentation Layer:**  
  A C# console application that serves as the user interface, interacting with the business logic layer.

This clear modular structure not only improves code maintainability but also simplifies testing and future enhancements.
